# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal website intended for prospective employers, recruiters, and anyone else interested so they can get to know me professionally.  I wanted to give them a sense of who I am, what I am interested in and what drives me, my career path and transition into software development, list relevant skills, provide some sample projects both as a new web developer and from my previous career that may be relevant, showcase some of my front-end dev skills, and of course some means to get in touch with me.

## Installation

There are no extra installation requirements aside from a browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Internet Explorer.
